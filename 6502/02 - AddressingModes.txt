6502 Addressing Modes
=====================

Any questions about anything, ask in chat!

Now that you have a basic understanding of the main 6502 instructions, we have to learn addresssing modes.

Addressing modes are different ways to access things. An address is basically "what" you want to manipulate.

Some addressing modes are simply values, like the immediate addressing mode. E.g. #$20

Some are actual addresses, like the absolute addressing mode. E.g. $2000

Depending on the complexity of the address mode you use, it can take more clocks to complete the desired operation.

Some addressing modes add the number of bytes an opcode takes up.
    E.g. RTS is always a one byte instruction, LDA $20 is two bytes total, but LDA $2000 is three bytes total.

Here are all the different ways addressing modes that instructions can use.
    NOTE: Not all instructions can use all addressing modes. But basically all can use what they'd logically need.
    NOTE: You shouldn't have trouble remembering which instructions can use which. You will learn them with time.

ADDRESSING MODES:
=================

Addressing mode: Implicit
    This mode has no extra information associated. E.g. RTS

Addressing mode: Accumulator
    Works on the A register. E.g. ROR A, The Accumulator is being rotated, not a memory address.

Addressing mode: Immediate
    Works on a given value. E.g. LDA #$20, #$20 is the immediate value.

Addressing mode: Absolute
    Works on a given (16-bit) address. E.g. LDA $2000, $2000 is the absolute address.

Addressing mode: Absolute X indexed
    Works on a given address + X. E.g. X=#$10, LDA $2000,X loads the A register with whatever is at $2010.

Addressing mode: Absolute Y indexed
    Works on a given address + Y. E.g. X=#$FF, LDA $400,Y loads the A register with whatever is at $4FF.

Zeropage (ZP) is the address $0000 to $00FF. It is special address mode because:
1. Since only one byte is needed to know where to manipulate the data, the code is smaller.
2. Because it loads less information, these instructions execute faster.

Addressing mode: Zeropage X indexed
    Address is $ZP + X. If X=#$05, STA $10,X stores the A register into memory location $15.

Addressing mode: Zeropage Y indexed
    Address is $ZP + Y. If Y=#$03, STA $12,Y stores the A register into memory location $15.

Addressing mode: Relative (Branches ONLY)
    Moves the PC (program control) -128 to +127 from (basically the) current position.
    This addressing mode adds one byte to the opcode. This byte tells it where to go if the branch condition was met.

Addressing mode: Indirect
    Goes to address pointed to by address. E.g. JMP ($FFFC) looks at bytes $FFFC and $FFFD, and goes to there.

Addressing mode: Indexed Indirect (ZP only, X index register only)
    Goes to the address ZP+X points to. E.g. X=#$02, LDA ($10,X), goes to the address pointed to by $12 and $13. 

Addressing mode: Indirect Indexed (ZP only, Y index register only)
    Goes to the address pointed to by ZP addr, add Y. E.g. Y=#$04, LDA ($08),Y, loads A with whatever $8 and $9 point to, plus Y.

That's all the addressing modes available! Don't worry about the complex ones. By the time you see them, you'll be great at these.

Also, the 6502 is little endian. That means low bytes are FIRST when accessing data. E.g. $2000 is stored as #$00,#$20 in the instruction.
Also, I won't go into much detail, but the more complex the address mode, the longer it takes to run. (Up to 7 clocks for 1 instruction!)
