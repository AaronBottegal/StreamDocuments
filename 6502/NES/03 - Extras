PPU Extras:
    PPU displays sprites using OAM. Object attribute memory.
        These "objects" (called sprites) are displayed on top of the background.
        These are usually use for the moving characters and non-static objects in games.
    To upload the sprites to the PPU, you have to write the sprite OAM data using special registers.
        .OAM data is 256 bytes. Writing each byte in code would take a long time.
        To do this faster, you use the special PPU OAM DMA register.
            DMA stands for direct memory access. It moves the data for you manually, basically.
    The DMA hardware pauses the CPU and moves the data for you.
        (It's about 10x faster than doing it manually, so your game can do more complex things elsewhere.)
    Using PPU register $4014, you can store the high byte ($XX00) of the OAM sprite data.
        This write triggers the DMA harwdare to pause the CPU and move the data to the PPU OAM register for you.
        It will upload the 256 bytes of OAM data in ~512 cycles. This helps not slow down the NES.
        OAM is 4 bytes per object. 256 bytes of OAM provide you 64 sprites on screen.
    If 8 sprite objects are on the same horizontal line, the PPU can't display them all.
        It will show the first 8 lowest objects in OAM memory. Any more do not get displayed.
        This is why objects flicker with too many things in a row.
        The flickering is added in by the game to try to make sure you can see all objects.
    OAM data format is as follows.
        Byte 0: YYYY YYYY - Sprite Y position on screen.
        Byte 1: TTTT TTTT - Tile index. Aka which 8x8 pixels from graphics ROM are this "sprite" image.
        Byte 2: VHB- --PP - (V) Vertical flip, (H) Horizontal flip, (B) Behind background enable, (P) Palette index, 0 (%00) to 3 (%11).
        Byte 3: XXXX XXXX - Sprite X position on screen.
