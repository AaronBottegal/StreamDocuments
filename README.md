# About Me

I'm Aaron Bottegal ([Linguine Penguiny on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/linguinepenguiny)) and I stream video game reverse engineering. This is the complete tearing apart them, the code that actually makes them run! I do it for fun, to try to discover new things inside them, document the history inside of them, and lastly to even provide others with similar ability to myself to modify the games themselves easier by providing usable source code to games!

# About these documents.

The documents here are to help you learn how the video game systems work. They are numbered in order.

Start by reading the documents in this main directory to learn the basics of computer processors and their alternate numbering systems to understand the basics of computers and processors.

Then, read the documents in the folder of that platform's processor to learn how that specific processor works. E.g. 6502, 6809.

Lastly, read the documents in the folder of the systems name to learn how that systems hardware works. E.g. NES, Williams.



If you are interested in learning about Duck Hunt's code, the processor is 6502 and the system is NES.

If you are interested in learning about Defender's code, I will be making these documents soon. I'll explain any questions in stream for now.
Defender's processor will be 6809 and the platform will be Williams.



But if you have any issues understanding anything, I encourage you to come chat in the stream to ask any questions you need to understand clearer! I stream to teach people general programming, assembly language programming, Linux (Which is what I stream on), git, and any subject you think I could explain! So please, talk to me and ask me any questions in any of those realms. I, and maybe later on, others, will be able to help you and let you understand our very interesting work!



# Pull requests welcome.

If something could be done better, or is unclear, I will review pull requests to help improve these documents. I'll probably be very strict on changes for formatting and scope, but am willing to change the content to be clear and concise.
