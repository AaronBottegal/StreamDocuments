# About Me

I'm Aaron Bottegal ([Linguine Penguiny on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/linguinepenguiny)) and I stream NES game reverse engineering. This is the complete tearing apart them, the code that actually makes them run! I do it for fun, to try to discover new things inside them, document the history inside of them, and lastly to even provide others with similar ability to myself to modify the games themselves easier by providing usable source code to games!

# About these documents.

The documents here are to help YOU learn how to program the NES, if you don't know how to already. If you do, the tool I'm using will be easy to follow. But otherwise, the documents start by covering the numbering used in computers and the logic behind it in the first couple lessons. It then discusses the 6502 processor overview, instructions the 6502 has, addressing modes for modifying locations working with, and lastly NES hardware. These documents are supposed to be very general and mainly supposed to be consumed in order and only when you understand the previous document. They also are made to be quick references that have pretty much all data we will need to figure out the games inside of it. not necessarily every single features of every single part of the NES, just the most important. If more information is needed, check out the [NESDev Wiki](http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Nesdev_Wiki) for very in-depth knowledge of NES harwdare.  

But if you have ANY issues understanding ANY of it, I encourage you to come chat in the stream to ask any questions you need to understand clearer! I stream to teach people programming, NES programming, Linux (Which is what my desktop runs), and any subject you think I could explain! So please, talk to me and ask me any questions in any of those realms. I, and maybe later on, others, will be able to help you and let you understand our very interesting work!

# Pull requests welcome.

If something could be done better, or is unclear, I will review pull requests to help improve these documents. I'll probably be very strict on changes for formatting and scope, but am willing to change anything still!
